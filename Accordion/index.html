                    AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to machines that can mimic human intelligence.
                    It works by processing data, learning patterns, and making decisions based on that data.
                    Common techniques include machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing.

                    Machine learning is a subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data without explicit programming. 
                    It uses algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions. 
                    Types include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
